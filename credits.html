                    <h3>Interview to professor Paco Peraza:</h3>
                    <p>
                       <li>Why did you decide to become a professor?</li> 
                        He said:"I like teaching, I started as a hobby when I was at the university. 
                        <br>When I arrived to Vallarta, I was invited to teach, so I tried and from there,
                        I´ve always enjoyed teaching."
                        <li>Why did you decide to teach at CBTis 68?</li>
                        He said:"When I arrived to Vallarta, I started to work at Josefina Chavez,<br> 
                        from there, I met engineer Espinoza, who was director of CBTis68 and he 
                        invited me to work<br>because there were no teachers in the programming area with 
                        the right profile, those who taught before were mathematicians."
                        <li>How do you organize your classes?</li>
                        He said:"DGETI has study plans, has agendas and provides us with content,<br>
                        from there, there are state academy meetings in which they tell us what subjects<br>
                        and languages are going to be taught and an academy work is done to obtain content,
                        <br>from there, we do the activity planning, I´ve a logbook in Excel where I 
                        put the topics that I´m<br>seeing or I put the exercises, the weightings or 
                        points, and also, to study the material."
                        <li>If you were not a teacher, what else would you have done?</li>
                        He said:"I like my career, me for example, work as a teacher and in my free<br>
                        time I work in software development, I´m currently working in a company of real 
                        <br>estate, but from home, I give them support and I made a collection system for 
                        them, then, I would dedicate to software development.<br>"
                        <li>What has been your greatest achievement?</li>
                        He said:"My children."
                       <li>What advice could you give to students?</li>
                        He said:"In the school sense, that they don´t stop studying, many stay here,<br>
                        that finish an university career and that they really value what parents do for them.
                        <br>In the general sense, I think they´re fundamental, if there is no respect for
                        oneself and others, there´s a lot of conflict<br>and the responsibility makes 
                        your life lighter."
