                    <h3>Interview to professor Paco Peraza:</h3>
                    <p>
                       <li>Why did you decide to become a professor?</li> 
                        He said:"I like teaching, I started as a hobby when I was at the university. 
                        <br>When I arrived to Vallarta, I was invited to teach, so I tried and from there,
                        I´ve always enjoyed teaching.<br>"
                        <li>Why did you decide to teach at CBTis 68?</li>
                        He said:"When I arrived to Vallarta, I started to work at Josefina Chavez,<br> 
                        from there, I met engineer Espinoza, who was director of CBTis68 and he 
                        invited me to work<br>because there were no teachers in the programming area with 
                        the right profile, those who taught before were mathematicians.<br>"
                        <li>How do you organize your classes?</li>
                        He said:"DGETI has study plans, has agendas and provides us with content,<br>
                        from there, there are state academy meetings in which they tell us what subjects<br>
                        and languages are going to be taught and an academy work is done to obtain content,
                        <br>from there, we do the activity planning, I have a logbook in Excel where I 
                        put the topics that I am<br>seeing or I put the exercises, the weightings or 
                        points, and also, to study the material.<br>"
                        <li>If you were not a teacher, what else would you have done?</li>
